<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
  <h3>Game Title</h3>
  <p>Tempo Turmoil</p>
    <p></p>
  
  <h3>Tagline</h3>
  <p>After being transported into a music app, you need to ride the rhythm to escape!</p>
  <p></p>
    
  <h3>Concept Statement</h3>
  <p>Tempo Turmoil will be an arcade-style rhythm game where the player must complete
    puzzles to the beat of the music. It’s set within the digital world of a music app,
    which is where the main character is trapped. The main goal is to solve puzzles while
    avoiding enemies to escape unscathed. The player can accomplish this by staying on
    rhythm to effectively traverse the map, pushing around blocks to unlock the exits,
    and avoiding enemies. The player must multitask between solving puzzles and keeping
    up with the beat of each song and the changing rhythm while also running from, evading,
    and trapping enemies.</p>
    <p></p>
  
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
For the setting of the game, the player would be transported into and trapped inside the music app of a computer, MP3 player, or phone. They would be required to traverse the digital landscape that they're trapped inside in an attempt to find an exit. In this game, both the characters and the obstacles would be scattered throughout the map in the form of enemies and puzzle pieces that either need to be avoided to prevent death or need to be sought out to complete each individual level.
<br>
The main character will be placed on a grid to move around. Music will be played during each level so they can move to the beat. The character will be outlined with arrows pointing in the directions the player can move, the beat will be divided in a manner that corresponds to each directional arrow, and each arrow will light up on the beat corresponding to its direction. Clicking the mouse (or tapping a button/screen) in time with the proper beat will make the character move in the corresponding lit-up direction. The player should be able to create their own memorable rhythm by moving in a specific pattern in tandem with the music. A puzzle, consisting of pushing blocks into their proper position, will need to be completed to unlock the exit door and complete each level. Since the beat would be divided in a way that corresponds to the directional arrows, square grids would use half-beats from songs with 4/4 timing signatures while triangular or hexagonal grids would use music with a 3/4 time signature. 
<br>
Struggling to stay on the beat is a failure that connects all game obstacles. Poor timing can move the character in the wrong direction, risking messing up the puzzle or running into an enemy or prolonging your time completing the level. Timing that is bad enough to fall on none of the beats will prevent the character from moving at all, risking getting caught by an enemy if they’re chasing you.
<br>
Game characters and level characteristics change slightly throughout the course of the game, mostly in the form of elements related to movement. Characters’ speed and timing will change from level to level based on difficulty. Enemy behavior is also a factor that changes throughout the game. Some of the enemies will randomly roam the grid, some of the enemies will be confined to one particular area on the grid and move in a specific pattern, and some of the enemies will chase the player around the grid. These changes would be caused by unlocking new levels. The player’s motivation to continue playing is to eventually escape the digital labyrinth within the music app.
<br>
The experience that I'd like for my game to invoke would be getting the player into the flow of the music for each level while they dedicate focus to strategic decision-making and pattern anticipation.
  </p>

  <h3>Competition</h3>
  <p>
A pre-existing game that is similar to my proposal is Crypt of the Necrodancer. It’s a dungeon crawl rhythm game where the main character must move to the beat to traverse a dungeon, battling enemies and collecting treasures along the way. There are a few things that distinguish my concept from this game:
<br>
My game would function on a one-button control design to move the main character around the grid, rather than the up/down/left/right buttons used in many rhythm games. The player doesn’t focus on WHICH buttons to press — They focus on WHEN to press the singular button. This sort of simplicity leads to greater complexity in terms of directional movement. In this way, the game would be much more rhythm-focused because it puts extra emphasis on maintaining proper timing. The simple controls would also make it very convenient to play on something like a smartphone rather than a computer. The grid layout will also be different and have more diversity. Rather than only going up/down/left/right on a square grid, my game would allow the player to traverse grids that are square (both upright and diagonal), triangular, and hexagonal. Another difference is that the player will have unlimited time to complete the levels. Although it would make enemies more likely to corner and catch the player, lingering on a level wouldn’t directly cause a lose condition. In addition to this, the puzzle to unlock the exit must be completed for the player to win each level. Simply surviving until the end of a song will not thrust the player into the next section of the game.
